# Project Programming and Scripting
## The Irsis Flower data set
### 1.Projet Plan.
This project concerns the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set. You must research the data set and write documentation and code in Python to investigate it. 
### 2.- The Problem to solve.
You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed. 
### 3.- Methodology to follow
This project has been developed fulfilling the following objectives:
#### 3.1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.

#### 3.2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.

#### 3.3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
   
* outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,

* saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and

* outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.

## I. Introduction.
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus". 
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

## II. Bibliographic Research Process.

Thanks to the database offered by the GMIT library and the information provided in the instructions document where we are instructed to start the research process from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Iris data set.

<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris>.

In the GMIT library database we have found more than 150 scientific articles and books that refer to Ronald Fisher. The results offered by the repository as a document are attached in a separate document.
 
There has been a detailed investigation of Fisher's Iris dataset, for example: In the GMIT library database we have selected three books.

The three etitles below (use the advanced search option in search + search. Enter the Python script and the iris dataset) refer to Fisher's iris dataset. Just use the 'search inside' function on each title and key in the iris dataset.

#### Python Machine Learning - Second Edition

#### Mastering Social Media Mining with Python

#### Some journal articles:

Advanced search in search+find: iris dataset AND python programming language.  Limit to academic journals. Retrieves 4.  First 3 reference iris data set and give examples of code? Use CTRL F within the article and search for iris dataset.

These article are from Science Direct database so perhaps search that individual database only from our list of databases on library homepage.
Keyword search: iris datset and python script.  You will retrieve circa 68 results and you can limit them by subscribed journals(full text), pub title, date, article type.

A detailed research has also been done in Google Academico and has given us a result of 1350 articles and texts that refer to "Fisher’s Iris dataset + Python"

The following table depicts an excerpt of the Iris dataset, which is a classic example in the field of machine learning. The Iris dataset contains the measurements of 150 Iris flowers from three different species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Here, each flower sample represents one row in our dataset, and the flower measurements in centimeters are stored as columns, which we also call the features of the dataset:
